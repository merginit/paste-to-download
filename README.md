Paste Image to Download
</h1>

[Paste Image to Download](https://paste.photos/) is a utility website made by [Alejandro Akbal](https://akbal.dev)
for downloading images in your clipboard.

This tool was made for those moments where you take a screenshot and it is directly copied to the clipboard. \
Instead of going to MS Paint, pasting the image, choosing a location and saving it... \
**You can just paste it in this website.**
